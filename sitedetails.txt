## OutlineCV: Site Flow & Design Analysis

### **Overall Purpose**
OutlineCV is a clean, minimalist portfolio/resume website template for a content-first professional (Sasha Mozdir, an editorial systems specialist and entrepreneur). Built with Framer, it showcases work through a narrative-driven approach rather than traditional CV format.

### **Visual Design Principles**

**Color System**:

- Vibrant accent colors for case study icons:
  - Dark Gray, Pink, Purple, Cyan, Red, Lime Green
  - Each case gets a distinct color for visual scanning
- Emoji badges (🔒 NDA, ✨ checkmarks) for quick status identification

**Typography**:
- Clean, readable sans-serif (appears to be system font or neutral web-safe)
- Clear hierarchy: Large titles → section headers → body text
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Inline links colored in context (blue for clickable text)

**Layout**:
- Single-column layout (mobile-first responsive design)
- Maximum line length ~65-70 characters for readability
- Consistent 16-24px spacing between sections
- Minimal UI elements - no sidebars or complex navigation

**Interactive Elements**:
- Subtle hover states on links (implied by design)
- Loading spinner animation (turquoise circle) when navigating between pages
- "LOAD MORE" button for progressive content disclosure
- Framer badge in bottom-right (template attribution)
