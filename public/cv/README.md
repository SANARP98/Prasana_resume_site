# CV Files

Place your CV files (PDF or DOCX) in this folder.

The files will automatically appear in the CV dropdown menu on the website.

## Naming Convention

For best results, use descriptive names:
- `Prasana_CV_DevSecOps.pdf`
- `Prasana_CV_CloudSecurity.pdf`
- `Prasana_Resume_Full.pdf`
- `Prasana_CV_Platform_Engineer.docx`

The filename (without extension) will be displayed in the dropdown menu with underscores replaced by spaces.
