Qualitest Group	
●	Architect and operate DevSecOps workflows, automating SAST (SonarQube), DAST (Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP), SCA (Snyk) and template-based automated penetration testing using ProjectDiscovery Nuclei across enterprise CI/CD platforms (Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Bamboo). Integrate container image scanning (Trivy, Grype, JFrog Xray) and secret/source scanning (Gitleaks, TruffleHog, git-secrets) to detect vulnerabilities and hard-coded secrets early in the SDLC.
●	Design and implement secure CI/CD pipeline architecture with automated security gates, scan stages, artifact integrity checks and secrets management via Azure Key Vault. Standardize infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, Ansible and Azure Bicep/ARM templates, reducing configuration drift and improving deployment consistency.
●	Design and implement an AI-driven IaC security scanning and remediation pipeline using Azure OpenAI and a custom knowledge base of secure vs. insecure Terraform/Bicep/ARM patterns. The pipeline scans IaC code for security violations, generates secure patches, applies changes automatically or via review/approval, and re-scans to verify remediation.
●	Implement automated open-source and license compliance scanning using ScanCode and ORT Scan (OSS Review Toolkit) to generate SBOMs, identify license/compliance risks and feed results into CI/CD reports and governance dashboards.
●	Develop an AI-assisted secrets detection tool that processes large codebases into smaller chunks, calls an internal AI model (trained on company-specific sensitive terms and credential patterns) via API, aggregates responses and generates detailed reports, reducing the risk of company secrets and credentials being committed to repositories.
●	Co-develop an AI-enforced LLM usage proxy for tools like ChatGPT and Claude by building a backend HTTP proxy server and Chrome extension that intercept user prompts, sends them to the internal AI model for sensitive-content checks and allows or blocks requests accordingly. Monitor usage and tune detection thresholds to reduce false negatives while minimizing user friction.
●	Perform cloud security audits on Azure infrastructure, assessing IAM policies, network segmentation (NSGs, WAF, Application Gateway), configuration baselines and monitoring setups (Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Sumo Logic, ELK/EFK). Deliver formal audit reports with prioritized remediation items and track closure with stakeholders.
●	Lead full-stack design and development of an in-house security product using Python, Node.js, Go and MongoDB, deployed on Azure as containerized microservices (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm). Implement Kubernetes security best practices (Pod Security Standards, CIS Kubernetes Benchmark validation) and automate web-application security testing, vulnerability tracking and reporting; act as solution architect, hands-on developer and project lead.
●	Consult with enterprise clients across Europe and the US on application and cloud security posture, performing vulnerability assessments, risk prioritization, root-cause analysis and secure-coding guidance for development teams, improving remediation timelines and security ownership.
●	Embed security and compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, NIST CSF, CIS Benchmarks, OWASP and, where applicable, ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, TX-RAMP) into IaC guardrails, pipeline policies, security checklists and code review processes, enabling continuous compliance across internal tools and cloud deployments.
●	Design and maintain observability and security monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, Sumo Logic and ELK/EFK, building dashboards and alerts for CI/CD pipelines, containerized workloads and Azure infrastructure to detect anomalies and security incidents in near real-time.
●	Conduct security testing and penetration testing (pentesting) for internal tools and platforms, providing detailed vulnerability analysis, remediation plans and secure-coding guidance, reducing recurring issues and overall security debt.
●	Lead team upskilling initiatives on DevSecOps practices, IaC security, Kubernetes hardening and vulnerability management through knowledge-sharing sessions and hands-on workshops, strengthening security maturity across the organization.

●	Developed a tick data collection subsystem to ingest and store per-second (tick-level) market data for later backtesting, analytics and strategy refinement using time-series-optimised storage.
●	Architected a microservices-based backend using Python, Flask and custom services, with TimescaleDB, SQLite and MySQL to store market data, backtest results and trading state, and Confluent Kafka for streaming events between components.
●	Orchestrated data collection, AI inference and trade execution workflows using n8n and OpenAlgo, wiring together TradingView webhooks, AI analysis, risk checks and order placement into a cohesive automated pipeline.
●	Implemented risk and position management logic for margin-aware position sizing, trailing stop-loss, trailing take-profit and dynamic profit-booking, allowing the bot to capture extended trends while protecting downside.
●	Integrated a Telegram bot interface to send real-time notifications on trades, P&L and backtest reports, and to allow users to interact with the system (e.g., send stop signals, pause strategies or trigger manual actions) via Telegram messages.
●	Deployed the system as containerized microservices on VMs across AWS, Azure and GCP, managing environment configuration, secrets and monitoring for both live trading and paper trading modes.
●	Acted as end-to-end owner (quant research, architecture, backend development, deployment and optimisation), iterating on strategy logic, reliability and execution latency based on live behaviour and backtest outcomes.

Git-RAG-Chatbot – Local RAG Git Assistant for Developers
●	A local, Docker-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that lets developers query internal Git repositories in natural language. The system periodically indexes repositories, chunks source files, generates embeddings with an LLM embedding model, and stores them in ChromaDB as a vector store. Each chunk is enriched with metadata (repository, file path, language, symbol/function context, commit info) to keep code context intact and improve retrieval quality.
●	The chat UI is built with Gradio, backed by a Python service that performs vector search over ChromaDB and composes prompts from the most relevant code/context before calling Codex CLI / ChatGPT Enterprise. Runs fully in Docker for easy local deployment and privacy, and is designed to help developers search code, understand implementations and generate/refine patches using natural-language queries.

Smart Elevator using Machine Learning Techniques (Prototype Project)
●	Designed and prototyped a contactless smart elevator system that predicts a user’s destination floor using RFID-based location tracking and machine learning, aiming to minimise button presses and waiting time.
●	Built the hardware stack using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and NodeMCU (ESP8266), integrating RFID readers, cameras and elevator-control relays to sense user presence at hotspots and trigger elevator calls.
●	Implemented firmware and control logic on Arduino/NodeMCU for RFID tag reading, sensor input handling and communication with the Raspberry Pi controller.
●	Collected movement data from RFID readers and camera streams to create a dataset of user travel patterns; applied image processing and ML models to predict likely destination floors based on user identity and recent movement history.
●	Developed the central controller on Raspberry Pi to fuse sensor data, run the prediction model and send elevator commands, achieving a working lab-scale prototype demonstrating automatic floor selection and contactless operation.
●	Collaborated with teammates on system design, hardware integration, model training and testing, and documented the architecture and control flow for future expansion to a full building-scale deployment.

Self-balancing single wheel using mechanical gyroscope (Prototype Project)
